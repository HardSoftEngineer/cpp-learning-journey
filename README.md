# C++ learning journey

This repository documents my C++ learning journey, from revisiting core language fundamentals to building more efficient and production-oriented code.

I have previous academic and practical experience with C/C++, including pointers and manual memory management. This repository focuses on rebuilding and deepening my understanding of modern C++ through practice and focused code examples.

The repository is organized by topics and complexity levels. Early sections may contain simple or basic code, while later sections revisit similar ideas with better design, modern C++ features, and performance considerations. The long-term goal is to build efficient computer vision applications beyond Python prototypes.
